# AtCoder Auto Tester

An Script for auto testing on AtCoder Beginners Contest.

## TODO
- ABC CONTEST ONLY It can run test only ABC contest (because I participate ABC contest mainly)
- LOGIN It cannot use during contests because users must login to access problems during contest
- OTHER LANG It currently support only C++ (my primary lang in competitive programming)
It is stil under development! Thank you!:D
